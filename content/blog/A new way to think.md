# A New Way to Think

A couple weeks ago I was working on an assignment in addition to thinking about a couple different projects of my own. Being a student I will typically distract myself from school work whenever possible, and though that was true in this case as well, there was something a little different. After being distracted with one of my own thoughts for a few minutes, when I came back to the problem I was working on in my school work, I realized I had subconsciously made progress.

For much of the afternoon I was constantly flipping between the different tasks, it felt like every 10 minutes I would switch to thinking about something else. While obviously I could only consciously think about one thing at a time, I was still able to process several ideas at the same time subconciously. It felt simply as though my conscious thought couldn't keep pace. To use a computer analogy (which I will probably use several of throughout this piece), it felt like I could run multi-threaded processes, and yet I still can only print one at a time. As a little illustration, if I run a simple for-loop in Julia using 4 threads, while the computer is able to process these all at the same time, you can see that it only prints them out one at a time, and not even in order.

Because this really felt like a bottle-neck in my ability to process information I started thinking about how to alleviate that bottle-neck: How do I consciously process information faster.

This reminded me of a [paper](https://eliasl.com/Papers/Final%20Essay%20ENGL1170.pdf) I wrote last year for my short stories class. In the paper I reference the short story ["Story of Your Life"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life) by Ted Chiang, of which the film *[Arrival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)) i*s based off of. In the story, aliens land on Earth and a team is sent to go investigate it and try to figure out how to communicate with them. Eventually they figure out that the Aliens' primary way of communication is a written one made of [semaisiographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semasiography) which look like this:

The idea is that entire sentences, or even paragraphs can be communicated in each semaisiograph. Small spoiler alert, in the story it's revealed that this allows the aliens to traverse time freely, just as we can traverse space. While I certainly don't believe that's a possibility, I do think creating a new language like this could be of real value. Here's why.

English (or basically any other common language across the world), is actually terribly inefficient at communicating information. It is foremost a spoken language as so much of the meaning is derived from context or inflection. A favorite example of mine is the sentence "I never said she ate my sandwich" which has seven different meanings depending on which word you choose to emphasize. In addition even in written form I (and presumably most other people) read it by simply reciting it "verbally" in my head.

This is terribly inefficient because it takes a relatively long amount of time to both say and process each individual word, and each word alone conveys little information, its when taken together that you get the strength of English. So for any even semi-complex ideas it takes many words and thus a lot of time in order to process the ideas present. This bound on information processing speeds is not a result of human's inate processing speed, but rather the language.

When looking at images humans can process information at lightening speeds compared to written or spoken language. We can recognize a face on the order of 100ms. If we were to try and recognize the same person, but through a written description instead of an image, not only is it most likely impossible, but if it is, it would probably be on the order of several minutes to be equally confident. This is about 1000x slower if even possible. Also, chances are you'll probably recognize the following image, especially if you're American or are familiar with New York.

If you do recognize this location, then you know its Times Square in Manhattan. But not only that you could probably recognize several of the advertisements like Coca-Cola or Spiderman, the line of iconic yellow taxis, the crowd of people, the bushes separating the people and the street, and so many other specifics of the situation that are next to impossible to put into words: the exact cloud coverage, the shimmering of the buildings, how the street seems to disappear into infinity. And, you were probably able to processes all of those things in a couple seconds.

Clearly, we can process a lot of information quickly, certainly much faster than reading it. There are a few key ideas that we can use from images and the aliens semaisiograph language.

1. Dimensions - Images and semaisiographs use two dimensions to convey information. English on the other hand is a 1-dimensional string of characters which constitute words and sentences and so on.
2. Time vs space - Images and semaisiographs primarily use two dimensions of space, but one can also use time and present one after another. English however requires time, a collection of words doesn't convey any meaning without their order as they're read.
3. Modularity - This is where English takes the win. English can be broken down into different sized chunks (words, sentences, paragraphs, etc) that can be interchanged and reused. Images on the other hand have no such ability. Semaisiographs fall somewhere in the middle.

So in order to construct our new language, we clearly want to take the best parts. We want it to use 2-dimensions of space like images, but we also want it to be highly modular like English. Unfortunately I haven't had the time to actually design and then learn this language, but hopefully one day it'll be developed and we'll all be able to process information faster, and have a new way to think.

If you have any ideas or develop your own language please shoot me an email, I'd love to hear!
