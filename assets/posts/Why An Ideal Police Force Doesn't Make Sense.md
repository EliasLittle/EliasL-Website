Why even an ideal police force that's not oppressive, not systematically racist, and accountable doesn't make sense (A Thread):

First, we must ask "What are the police for?" 

They supposedly serve many roles, but most would say that they're primarily meant to deal with crime, and protect people. So given this, it is safe to say that police are touted as the solution to crime. (1/10)

If you think about the police's role in dealing with crime, they are primarily called, or patrol to deal with crimes that are already underway. This ranges from giving tickets to stopping robberies. Even when acting as guards, if someone shows up to commit a crime, they (2/10)

are only acting as a deterrent, not addressing the reason that person was thinking of committing a crime.

This is the crux of the issue. 

Police are touted as the solution to crime, but crime is not the problem. Crime is a symptom of deeper issues in our society. (3/10)

The real problems are issues such as poverty, access to food, education, health services (physical and mental), and inequality in general. 

When governments are told police will help with crime, they direct funds to the police, and away from other needed services like (4/10)

education, transportation, public health, affordable housing etc.... This leads to more crime, thus more 'need' for police, thus more funds directed to the police. This creates an endless cycle that ultimately ends in all funding going towards policing a state that (5/10)

receives no support from the government. Totalitarianism. 

This is all assuming a completely just, accountable police force. 

So how can we solve the root problems here? Well, it's not too complicated, simply run the cycle in reverse. More funding for public resources (6/10)

leads to less inequality and less crime, thus less need for police, thus more funding for public resources. Another endless cycle, but in a positive direction. 

This isn't to say we wouldn't still need public servants to help with problems, but it doesn't make sense to (7/10)

send an armed pseudo-soldier to go confront someone who stole some food in order to feed his family. In most cases, police could be replaced by non-armed social workers that at the very least could help determine where public funds need to be directed. (8/10)

From here, if you look at our current system, it resembles the first cycle where we are spending more and more money on police. In addition, most forces have next to none, or outright no accountability and enforce systematic racism, while plagued with other problems (9/10)

such as police brutality. 

So in order for us to get to a system that actually works for everyone, everyone must acknowledge that #BlackLivesMatter and that we must #DefundPolice (10/10)
